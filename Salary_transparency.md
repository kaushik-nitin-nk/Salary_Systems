2. Local points basd on the plant location (20.000 points in D√ºsseldorf)

3. Currency Factor (10‚Ç¨)

4. Role Fixum for everybody (1000‚Ç¨)

5. Loyalty 1,8% of base after 10 years it goes down to 1,2%

6. Experience counts if the employee has spent time with the topic

_Note: Factor 5 & 6 are frozen after 15 years_
