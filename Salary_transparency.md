# sipgate Salary System

Market oriented approach

No individual negotiation but individual salaries

Salary = Rolefactor

---

## Factors

1. Role factor (market analysis for the average annual salary for a person with 0-2 years of experience)

2. Local points basd on the plant location (20.000 points in Düsseldorf)

3. Currency Factor (10€)

4. Role Fixum for everybody (1000€)

5. Loyalty 1,8% of base after 10 years it goes down to 1,2%

6. Experience counts if the employee has spent time with the topic

_Note: Factor 5 & 6 are frozen after 15 years_

---

## Additional Factors

Studied and non-studied persons earn the same but studying costs time so if you study you lose time that you could have gathered for factor 5 & 6 so you receive:

plus 2000€ for a bachelors degree

plus 4000€ for a masters degree

plus X per day for on-call service
