1. Role factor (market analysis for the average annual salary for a person with 0-2 years of experience)

2. Local points basd on the plant location (20.000 points in Düsseldorf)

3. Currency Factor (10€)

4. Role Fixum for everybody (1000€)

6. Experience counts if the employee has spent time with the topic

_Note: Factor 5 & 6 are frozen after 15 years_
